cd Fundamentals/lecture-8

```

### 📝 APIs

To follow along with the APIs developed in the course, you can choose from these 3 options.

1. Open the respective lecture source code **root** directory and then in **docs** directory there is a file called
   `api.html` which you can open in your browser to see the documented API.

2. You can also import the `api.json` **(root directory/docs)** into the Postman.
