the respective lecture.

### Running the code

Select the particular section of interest and then open the directory for a `lecture-<lecture_no>`. Check the **README**
file for the instructions, branches/tags for the examples given in a lecture.

**_Example_**

```sh
cd Fundamentals/lecture-8
npm i
npm start
```

### 📝 APIs

To follow along with the APIs developed in the course, you can choose from these 3 options.

1. Open the respective lecture source code **root** directory and then in **docs** directory there is a file called
   `api.html` which you can open in your browser to see the documented API.

2. You can also import the `api.json` **(root directory/docs)** into the Postman.

3. Explore the respective lecture APIs in our public workspace hosted on Postman named
   [YT-NESTJS](https://bit.ly/3wJJKK6).
