## üé¨ Youtube [Video](https://youtu.be/GVvLBjTvf8E)

In some scenarios, we need to work with **Multiple Databases** which require our application to establish connections with the respective databases. This video explains how we can configure Mongoose with NestJS to have **Multiple DB & Multiple Connections** environments. Also, we will see a special case where a _single Database has different connections_.

‚ö†Ô∏è _(Need to install the **mongoose** & **@nestjs/mongoose** package. Already included in the **package.json**)_
