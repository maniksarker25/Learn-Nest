## üé¨ Youtube [Video](https://youtu.be/JWoXhRH5dxw)

In this video, we will study how to set up & configure the **MongoDB** database connection using the **Official Mongoose Package** from scratch. The **NestJS framework** already provides the **@nestjs/mongoose** package but in some cases, we want to take control of the process and do additional things that are not directly possible with the **@nestjs/mongoose** package and to overcome this we need to use the **official Mongoose package**.

‚ö†Ô∏è _(Need to install the **mongoose** & **@nestjs/mongoose** package. Already included in the **package.json**)_
