In this video, we will look into a very special feature of Mongoose which is **Discriminator**. The _Discriminators_ are a **Schema Inheritance Mechanism**. They allow us to have multiple models _inheriting common fields_ from a _parent schema_, and stored under the same _MongoDB collection_. 

⚠️ _(Need to install the **mongoose** & **@nestjs/mongoose** package. Already included in the **package.json**)_
