**Interceptors** in NestJS provide us many capabilities by intercepting the _Request and Response_, unlike **Middleware** which run on Request only. We can bind extra logic before and after _Route Handler Method Execution_ benefiting us from **AOP (Aspect-Oriented programming)**. In addition to that, Interceptors help us to `Override Method Behavior`, `Request Timeouts`, and much more.

In this video, we will explore the concept of **AOP**, **Interceptors**. Also we will see some use cases like `Read-through Cache` and `Request Timeouts`.
