Till now we are validating the simple form of data such as primitive values coming in the request. But to validate the `objects`, `nested objects`, or `complex` forms of data we can use the **JOI package** to validate against a schema, and this technique is called **Schema-based validation**. In this video, we will learn **Schema-based validation** by creating a custom `validation pipe`.


⚠️ _(Need to install the **joi** package. Already included in the **package.json**)_
