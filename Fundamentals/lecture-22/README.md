Custom Pipes allows us to perform transformation or validation based on our requirements that cannot be fulfilled with built-in pipes provided by the NestJS. 

In this two-part video, we will create a **Custom pipe - ParseDatePipe** to transform the _timestamps or date_ into desired date format. Along the way, we will see how to get benefit from **ArgumentMetadata** and **Dependency Injection** for configuring the custom pipe.
