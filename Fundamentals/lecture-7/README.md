## 🎬 Youtube [Video](https://youtu.be/7W4RdJmwAz4)

In this video, we will look into the concept of data submission. The request body contains the data sent by the client to the server. We will see how to read JSON and x-www-form-urlencoded data submitted by the client to the server. 

Also, we will touch on the DTO concept as a way to organise and transfer data within the application.
