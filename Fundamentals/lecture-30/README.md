This video explains the NestJS **Application Lifecycle** phases and events. Every NestJS application has a lifecycle, divided into 3 phases `initializing`, `running`, and `terminating`. Application Lifecycle events help us to perform additional logic at the appropriate moment like managing tasks, processes, connections, and more. We can also gracefully shut down our application when it receives a termination signal.
